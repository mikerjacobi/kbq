# Knowledge Base Query

This repository contains two Python scripts that allow you to generate a corpus of knowledge base articles and query it using natural language questions.

## Quick Start

```bash
# set your openapi key
$> export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-q9u...

# install dependencies
$> virtualenv venv
$> source venv/bin/activate
$> pip install -r requirements.txt

# generate knowledge base
$> python generate_corpus.py # generates file 'sample-content/corpus.csv'

# issue natural language questions against knowledge base
$> ./query_corpus.py "what operations exist on the openweathermap api?"
The OpenWeatherMap API offers a variety of operations ...
```

## Generate Corpus

The `generate_corpus.py` script reads in CSV, MD, and YAML files containing knowledge base articles and generates a corpus.csv file that includes the articles and their embeddings generated using the OpenAI GPT-3 language model. The embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the articles, allowing for more accurate matching when querying the knowledge base.

To use generate_corpus.py, simply specify the input files and run the script. The resulting corpus.csv file can be used by the query_corpus.py script to perform natural language queries.

## Query Corpus

The `query_corpus.py` script takes in a natural language question, calculates its embedding using the OpenAI GPT-3 language model, and queries the corpus.csv file to find the most relevant articles. The script then passes the relevant content to the OpenAI Davinci-003 model, which generates an answer to the question.

To use query_corpus.py, simply specify the input question and run the script. The script will output the most relevant article and its answer to the question.

By using these two scripts together, you can easily create and query a knowledge base of articles using natural language questions. The embeddings generated by the OpenAI GPT-3 language model provide a powerful way to match questions with relevant articles, and the OpenAI Davinci-003 model ensures that the answers are accurate and informative.
